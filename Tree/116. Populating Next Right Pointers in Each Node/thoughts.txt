At first, my thought is quite straight. use Queue, so i can use BFS. connect left and right node layer by layer.

Then i thought another solution which make use of TreeNode next, if the current node 's left is not null :
we can make left.next=right;
if current node's right.next != null
which means right.next=next.left

using recursion, it is quite simple and save the memory usage.
