When i first finish the question, i got a AC. But the solution is very slow. so i want to finger out the reason.
 i analyze the solution of others, i found that this is because ArrayList 
which i used to find whether the TreeNode should be delete is inefficient. 
And if i replaced the ArrayList with HashSet, my solution will be 6 more faster .

The knowledge i should care about is the principle of List and Set, and i should compare them in different operations.


Another quesions i met is when i try to fill a List<Integer> with int[] , for example List<Integer> r=new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(new Int[]{1,2})).
i cannot do it. after a while, i konw the reason. Because of generics, so i cannot use the  primitive type int .  i have to use the wrapper class Integer.
